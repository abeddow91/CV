## Anna Beddow

I'm Anna, a full-stack developer based in London. After working in mobile brand advertising alongside developers, I decided to make to transition to working as a developer instead; the best decision I ever made!

I have recently graduated from Makers Academy, a highly-selective, 16-week intensive coding bootcamp and am now looking for a Full Stack Junior Developer role in an exciting company that has tech at it's heart. I looking for a company where I can continue to grow and develop my programming skills within an Agile environment.


## Skills

Communication - With a degree in English Literature and 2 years experience as point of contact for both client-side and back-office, I understand how integral clean, clear and concise communication is to any role.

Adaptable - During my 16 weeks at Makers Academy, I have written in Ruby, Javascript, jQuery, Java and Swift and I am keen to continue these languages as well as developing more. 

Teamwork - With pair-programming and Agile methodologies at the heart of everything I undertook at Makers Academy, I am equipped with the necessary skills to succeed in a team environment.
